## Compilation of data analysis works

### [Mobility changes during covid](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Leonardojul/mobility_corona/blob/main/mobility-changes-during-covid.html)(ongoing)
My latest and current project focuses on answering the question of whether the population in the Netherlands does actually follow the governemtn restriction recommendations due to the Covid-19 outbreak. By comparing the timeline with all measurements in place and the mobility data during covid provided by Google public datasets, this projet aims to answer the question above and predict where will the populatiion concetrate on depending on which measures are currently in place (parks, residential areas, shopping areas, business areas...)

### [Customer support EDA](https://leonardojul.github.io/Customer-Support_EDA_Power_BI/)
This project was done for a company I worked for. It is aimed to provide an initial analysis of the customer support team by looking at ticket statistics, incoming work or work categorization. This project was the foundation to a set of measures and improvements proposed to the managemnt in order to overcome an understaffing situation as well as a work estimation reliablity issue.
