## Compilation of data analysis works


### [Customer support EDA](https://leonardojul.github.io/Customer-Support_EDA_Power_BI/)
This project was done for a company I worked for. It is aimed to provide an initial analysis of the customer support team by looking at ticket statistics, incoming work or work categorization. This project was the foundation to a set of measures and improvements proposed to the managemnt in order to overcome an understaffing situation as well as a work estimation reliablity issue.
