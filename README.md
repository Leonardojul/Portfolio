In this document you will find some of my works on different fields of data science. Below each title there is a short description of what the project is about and a collection of keywords listing the software or technology used, as well as some of the skills required to carry out the project.

For more information on eeach on of them, you may click the link in the title, which will take you directly to it's core, where further details can be found. Enjoy!

## Compilation of data science works

### [Forecasting System for a Customer Support Contact Centre](https://leonardojul.github.io/Forecasting-System/)

The customer support department required a fully automated solution to predict incoming work volumes through different channels (chat, email, phone...) and schedule the right amount of agents to cover the expected work, hire if necessary or know whether and how much time off could be granted on a given time period. This challenging project required very specific tailoring to both the business needs and what was possible given the data infrastructure. From data collection, pre-processing, forecasting and visualization, this project has been entirely created from scratch and runs reliably without human intervention. Finally a whole Power BI dahsboard was also implemented to provide end users with a user-friendly interactive space as well as a display of the model's accuracy performance.

This project focuses on answering the question of whether the population in the Netherlands does actually follow the governemtn restriction recommendations due to the Covid-19 outbreak. By comparing the timeline with all measurements in place and the mobility data during covid provided by Google public datasets, this projet aims to answer the question above and predict where will the populatiion concetrate on depending on which measures are currently in place (parks, residential areas, shopping areas, business areas...)

### [Customer support EDA](https://leonardojul.github.io/Customer-Support_EDA_Power_BI/)
<img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leonardojul/Portfolio/main/Ticket-history-analysis-1.png" width="50%" height="50%">

This project was done for a company I worked for. It is aimed to provide an initial analysis of the customer support team by looking at ticket statistics, incoming work or work categorization. This project was the foundation to a set of measures and improvements proposed to the managemnt in order to overcome an understaffing situation as well as a work estimation reliablity issue.

### [Financial analysis for a logistics company (Jupyter notebook)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Leonardojul/financial/blob/docs/Financial_analysis.html)
In this project I perfromed a financial overview of the Q1 and Q2 2020 for a logistics company. The data was used to inform the strategies for the next quarters on how to improve revenue attainment and which targets to set for a successful cost strategy.
